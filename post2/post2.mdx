While working on my blog project, I aimed to enhance user experience by facilitating easy navigation through content sharing common characteristics or topics. That's where **tags** play a crucial role; they are the perfect fit.

Tags function similarly to how a family shares a surname to signify their shared bloodline or bond.

As per ChatGPT, **tags** refer to keywords or labels assigned to digital content, including articles, blog posts, images, videos, or other media types, for the purpose of categorization and thematic organization.

However, simply having tags wasn't sufficient. I aspired to display a trending list showcasing the most occurring tags across all posts. This aspiration led me to develop a dedicated function for the task. Moreover, I ensured this function's versatility by allowing it to accept any data types, thereby enabling its reuse for various purposes as needed.

```ts
const getMostOccurringValues<T> = (arr: T[], count: number): T[] => {
  const occurrences = {} as Record<string, number>;

  arr.forEach((value) => {
    const key = JSON.stringify(value);
    occurrences[key] = (occurrences[key] || 0) + 1;
  });

  const sortedValues = Object.keys(occurrences)
    .sort((a, b) => occurrences[b] - occurrences[a])
    .map((key) => JSON.parse(key) as T);

  return sortedValues.slice(0, count);
}

```

Several key operations are involved in this function.

The function is of generic type `T`, ensuring its compatibility with any data type. It accepts two parameters:

- `arr: T[]`: An array of generic type `T`.
- `count`: A number determining the length of the list returned by the function.

The operations of the function are elaborated below:

- Occurrences Object: This object stores the count of each unique value in the array.
- Counting Occurrences:
  - Utilizing **forEach**, the function iterates through each value of the input array (`arr`).
  - For each iterated value, the function converts it to a string using `JSON.stringify()` to create a key for the occurrences object.
  - Subsequently, the function increments the count for that value in the occurrences object.
  - At this stage, we have an occurrences object with unique stringified **values**, each representing a unique value from the input array (`arr: T[]`), and the corresponding **counts**, indicating the number of times that value exists in the array, serving as the **value** of the key.
- Sorting Values by Occurrence:
  - The function first extracts the keys from the occurrences object using `Object.keys()`.
  - It then sorts these keys based on the occurrence count of each value in descending order using the `sort()` function.
  - The `sort()` function employs a comparison function that subtracts the occurrence counts (`occurrences[b] - occurrences[a]`) to sort the keys accordingly.
- Mapping and Slicing:

  - Next, the function maps the sorted keys back to their original values using `JSON.parse()` and casts them back to type `T`, which represents the data type of the values before they were stringified.
  - Finally, the function returns the top `count` values from the sorted array, based on the **count** parameter passed into the function.

  **Usage**

```TypeScript
const randomArray = [
    "Okunola",
    2,
    2,
    "Okunola",
    "Okunola",
    2.3,
    2.3,
    "javaScript",
    "javaScript",
    "python",
    "golang",
    { dele: "aaa" },
    { dele: "aaa" },
    { dele: "aaa" },
  ];

// Using the defined function to get the most occuring values
const topValues = getMostOccurringValues(randomArray, 3);
```

This provides a new list of the 3 most occuring values from `randomArray`

> [!NOTE]

```TypeScript
{dele: "aaa"},
// shows as
[Object Object]
//I had to stringify it as objects are not valied react children. The same object passed in will get returned by the function.
```

That concludes this post. Thank you for reading, and happy coding!
