intro: "Walk through implementing JWT in a Django rest framework project with me in this post"
---

In my previous post, I discussed implementing **JWT** tokens in an Express.js project. This post will guide you through the process of implementing JWT tokens in a Python Django project.

To follow along with this tutorial, it's assumed that you are already working on an API with Django Rest Framework and are interested in integrating JWT tokens into your authentication process.

We will be using `simple jwt`, a JSON Web Token authentication plugin for the Django REST Framework.

## Installation

Activate your virtual environment or skip this if you are not using one in your project. Replace **venv** with the name of your virtual environment file. Then run:

```python
# For Windows
source venv/Scripts/activate

# For Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

Begin by adding `djangorestframework` and `djangorestframework-simplejwt` to your **requirements.txt** file if you have. Then run:

```python
#Run
pip install requirements.txt -r
```

If you do not have the **requirements.txt** file, run:

```python
pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
pip install djangorestframework
```

Navigate to your `settings.py` and inform django of these new additions to your project by adding **rest_framework_simplejwt** to _INSTALLED_APPS_

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    #other apps
    'rest_framework', # add this
    'rest_framework_simplejwt', # add this
]
```

Create a new **api** app in your project if you do not have one already. This app will handle all authentication processes and paths. To create it, run the following command:

```python
python manage.py startapp api
```

In the api app, navigate to the `urls.py` file, add the following:

```python
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import (TokenObtainPairView, TokenRefreshView, TokenVerifyView)

urlpatterns = [
    path('token/', TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
    path('token/verify/', TokenVerifyView.as_view(), name='token_verify'),
]
```

By completing these steps, we will have the following endpoints available:

- The `token/` endpoint, which provides access and refresh tokens upon user authentication.
- The `token/refresh/` endpoint, used to refresh expired access tokens.
- The `token/verify/` endpoint, which validates tokens.

### Tokens expiration

To set an expiration time for the token, navigate to the `settings.py` file and add the following configuration:

```python
SIMPLE_JWT = {
    "ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME": timedelta(minutes=5), # set to preference
    "REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME": timedelta(days=1), # set to preference
    # Check the documentation for other settings
}
```

### usage

To apply this authentication to a particular view in any app within your project, navigate to the `views.py` file of that app and add the authentication class to the desired view.

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication import JWTAuthentication

# Apply this to the view
authentication_class = [JWTAuthentication]
```

To require authentication globally, navigate to your `settings.py` file. If the **_REST_FRAMEWORK_** dictionary does not exist, create it. Then, add the following configuration:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
        ],
}
```

You can now enforce authentication for access to specific views or globally across your entire project.

##### Closing

In conclusion, integrating JWTs into a Django project is remarkably straightforward and efficient compared to working with Nest.js or Express.js. Thanks to the pre-written logic, we simply import them as modules, which is quite convenient. It almost feels like a ridiculous shortcut! ðŸ˜… I'm grateful for having started by manually writing those logics in Express and Nest.js.

That concludes this post. Thank you for reading, and happy coding!
